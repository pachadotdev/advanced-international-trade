# Advanced International Trade in R

The links from [Feenstra's website](http://www.robertcfeenstra.com/graduate-text.html)
are currently broken, so I went to the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to
find the linked site (The Center for International Data) from 2005-03-08
and I downloaded it with `wget` (i.e., I run `bash 00-download-wayback-backup.sh`).

Then I started trying to replicate the same in R (with Quarto), because I do not
know Stata very well.

I have the first edition, so I am using the data from the first edition.

All the datasets and Stata codes are intellectual property of Dr. Robert C.
Feenstra. The R codes are of my authorship, but these are a translation of the
Stata codes, so I released them under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal.

Please do not hesistate to email me if this is useful, or if you have any
questions or suggestions. My email is on my GitHub profile.
