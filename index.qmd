# About 

I tried to replicate Feenstra's results in R, because I do not know Stata very
well. To organize my notes, I used Quarto to present my R outputs in a decently
formatted HTML file.

I have the first edition, so I am using the data from the first edition.

The links from [Feenstra's website](http://www.robertcfeenstra.com/graduate-text.html)
are currently broken, so I went to the Internet Archive Wayback Machine to
find the linked site (The Center for International Data) from 2005-03-08
and I downloaded it with `wget` (i.e., I run `bash 00-download-wayback-backup.sh`).

All the datasets and Stata codes are intellectual property of Dr. Robert C.
Feenstra. The R codes are of my authorship, but these are a translation of the
Stata codes, so I released them under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal.

Please do not hesistate to email me if this is useful, or if you have any
questions or suggestions. My email is on my GitHub profile.
